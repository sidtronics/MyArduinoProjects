# Analog to Digital converter
Simple code to demonstrate built-in ADC of Arduino using potentiometer in voltage divider configuration.

## Requirements:
1. Potentiometer (any value)

## Setup:
1. Connect end pins of potentiometer to 5V and GND pin of Arduino.
2. Connect slider pin to A0.
3. Compile and Upload.

## Output:
Serial monitor outputs corresponding ADC value based on voltage at slider pin. Adjust the Pot to change voltage.
