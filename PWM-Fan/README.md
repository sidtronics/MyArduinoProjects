# Control Fan RPM using PWM signals
This sketch is used to demonstrate PWM functionality to control Fan speed. 

## Requirements:
1. 4-Wire Computer Fan
2. 12V Power source

## Setup:
1. Connect PWM Pin of Fan to Pin 9.
2. Connect Tach Pin to Pin 2.
3. Connect Fan to 12V power supply.
4. Connect GND of Arduino to GND of power supply.
5. Compile and Upload.

## Output:
Serial monitor prints current PWM % and RPM. PWM is increased every 5s. Loops after reaching 100%.
